# CapSight Enhanced Operations Monitoring Playbook

## Overview
This playbook covers monitoring and maintaining the enhanced CapSight valuation system with robust estimators, conformal prediction, and automated accuracy tracking.

## System Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Robust Valuation API** (`pages/api/value.ts`)
   - Weighted median estimator with similarity kernels
   - Dynamic confidence bands via conformal prediction
   - Automatic fallback rules for edge cases
   - Full auditability with masked comps

2. **Enhanced Data Validator** (`validate_csv.py`)
   - Geofence validation for all markets
   - NOI consistency checks
   - Automated review queue flagging
   - Size/age bucket categorization

3. **Nightly Accuracy Monitor** (`nightly_accuracy.py`)
   - Automated backtesting across all markets
   - SLA compliance tracking (MAPE â‰¤10%, RMSE â‰¤50bps, Coverage 78-82%)
   - Bias detection and drift monitoring
   - Automated alerting for violations

4. **Database Schema**
   - `accuracy_metrics`: Rolling performance metrics
   - `comp_review_queue`: Data quality workflow
   - `v_comps_trimmed`: Outlier-filtered view
   - `latest_accuracy`: Current SLA status

## Daily Operations

### Morning Health Check (9 AM)
```sql
-- Check overall system health
SELECT * FROM v_system_health ORDER BY metric;

-- Verify nightly accuracy run completed
SELECT market_slug, last_updated, mape, rmse_bps, coverage80
FROM latest_accuracy 
WHERE last_updated >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY market_slug;
```

**Expected Results:**
- All 5 markets should have updated accuracy metrics from last night
- SLA passing rate should be >80% across markets
- Review queue should have <20 pending items

**Red Flags:**
- Any market missing from nightly update
- MAPE >15% or RMSE >75bps consistently
- Coverage <75% or >85% (miscalibrated)

### Weekly Performance Review (Monday 10 AM)

```sql
-- Weekly accuracy trend
SELECT 
    market_slug,
    AVG(mape) as avg_mape,
    AVG(rmse_bps) as avg_rmse,
    AVG(coverage80) as avg_coverage,
    COUNT(*) as data_points
FROM accuracy_metrics 
WHERE last_updated >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY market_slug
ORDER BY avg_mape DESC;

-- Data quality issues
SELECT 
    market_slug,
    reason,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    MIN(created_at) as first_seen,
    MAX(created_at) as last_seen
FROM comp_review_queue 
WHERE status = 'pending'
GROUP BY market_slug, reason
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Actions:**
- Review markets with degrading MAPE trends
- Process high-priority review queue items
- Update methodology documentation if needed

## SLA Monitoring

### Target SLAs
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: â‰¤10%
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: â‰¤50 basis points
- **Coverage**: 78-82% (80% confidence intervals)
- **Data Freshness**: â‰¤24 hours old
- **API Response Time**: <2 seconds (95th percentile)

### SLA Violation Response

#### MAPE > 10%
1. Check recent data quality in that market
2. Review comp mix - any unusual sales?
3. Verify market fundamentals are current
4. Consider temporary confidence band widening

```bash
# Investigate MAPE violation
python3 nightly_accuracy.py --market [MARKET] --dry-run --log-level DEBUG
```

#### RMSE > 50bps
1. Indicates systematic estimation errors
2. Check for market trend changes
3. Review cap rate time-adjustment factors
4. May need methodology recalibration

#### Coverage Outside 78-82%
1. **Coverage <78%**: Confidence bands too narrow (overconfident)
2. **Coverage >82%**: Confidence bands too wide (underconfident)
3. Review conformal prediction calibration
4. Adjust fallback rules if needed

## Data Quality Management

### Review Queue Processing
Priority order for manual review:
1. **Price outliers** (>$300/sf or <$20/sf)
2. **Cap rate outliers** (<3% or >12%)
3. **Geofence violations**
4. **NOI inconsistencies**
5. **Missing critical fields**

```sql
-- Daily review queue processing
SELECT 
    sale_id,
    market_slug,
    reason,
    address,
    created_at
FROM comp_review_queue 
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN reason LIKE '%Price/SF%' THEN 1
        WHEN reason LIKE '%Cap rate%' THEN 2
        WHEN reason LIKE '%geofence%' THEN 3
        WHEN reason LIKE '%NOI%' THEN 4
        ELSE 5
    END,
    created_at;
```

### Data Validation Workflow
1. **Incoming Data**: Enhanced CSV validator flags issues
2. **Auto-Triage**: High-confidence issues go to review queue
3. **Manual Review**: Operations team processes queue daily
4. **Resolution**: Accept, reject, or modify data points
5. **Re-validation**: Rerun accuracy metrics if significant changes

## Troubleshooting Guide

### API Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times (>5 seconds)
- Timeouts or 500 errors
- Memory usage spikes

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check API logs
tail -f logs/api.log | grep "valuation"

# Test API endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/value \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"market_slug":"dfw","noi_annual":500000,"building_sf":50000}'
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Review database query performance
- Check if too many comps being processed
- Verify connection pooling configuration
- Consider caching frequently requested markets

### Database Performance

**Symptoms:**
- Slow queries (>10 seconds)
- High CPU usage
- Connection pool exhaustion

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%v_comps_trimmed%'
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, attname, n_distinct, correlation
FROM pg_stats 
WHERE tablename IN ('comparables', 'fundamentals')
ORDER BY n_distinct;
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Add indexes on frequently filtered columns
- Update table statistics: `ANALYZE comparables;`
- Consider partitioning by market_slug
- Review RLS policy efficiency

### Accuracy Drift

**Symptoms:**
- Gradual MAPE increase over weeks
- Systematic bias in predictions
- Market-specific performance degradation

**Diagnosis:**
```python
# Run detailed market analysis
python3 -c "
import psycopg2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
cur = conn.cursor()

# Get 30-day rolling accuracy
cur.execute('''
    SELECT date_trunc('day', last_updated) as date, 
           AVG(mape) as daily_mape
    FROM accuracy_metrics 
    WHERE market_slug = 'dfw'
    AND last_updated >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
    GROUP BY date_trunc('day', last_updated)
    ORDER BY date
''')

dates, mapes = zip(*cur.fetchall())
plt.plot(dates, mapes)
plt.title('DFW MAPE Trend (30 days)')
plt.ylabel('MAPE')
plt.show()
"
```

**Common Fixes:**
- Review recent comp additions for outliers
- Check if market fundamentals changed
- Recalibrate time-decay parameters
- Update market trend adjustments
