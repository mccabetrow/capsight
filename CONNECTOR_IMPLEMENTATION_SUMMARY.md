# Connector Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive open data ingestion pipeline with 6 specialized connectors and enhanced scoring/financial modeling engine.

## Implemented Connectors

### 1. SEC EDGAR Connector (`connectors/edgar.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Fetches REIT and real estate company filings from SEC EDGAR
- **Data Sources**: Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K with real estate schedules
- **Output**: NOI, debt ratios, property counts, asset values
- **Features**: CIK resolution, filing parsing, structured data extraction
- **Rate Limits**: 10 requests/second per SEC guidelines

### 2. FRED Connector (`connectors/fred.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Federal Reserve Economic Data for macro indicators
- **Data Sources**: DFF, GS10, CRE lending standards, employment
- **Output**: Interest rates, lending conditions, economic indicators
- **Features**: API key auth, series caching, multi-series fetching
- **Rate Limits**: 120 requests/minute

### 3. Census/ACS Connector (`connectors/census.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Demographics, income, housing from US Census
- **Data Sources**: American Community Survey 5-year estimates
- **Output**: Population, income, education, housing stats
- **Features**: Geography-based queries, variable mapping, bulk fetching
- **Rate Limits**: 500 requests/day

### 4. HUD Connector (`connectors/hud.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Housing market data from Department of Housing
- **Data Sources**: Fair Market Rent, income limits, ZIP crosswalks
- **Output**: Rent benchmarks, affordability metrics, geography mappings
- **Features**: FMR by bedroom count, income limit calculations
- **Rate Limits**: Respectful querying with exponential backoff

### 5. Socrata Connector (`connectors/socrata.ts`)
- **Purpose**: City/state open data via Socrata/ArcGIS platforms
- **Data Sources**: Building permits, assessments, zoning, violations
- **Output**: Property-level permits, assessments, regulatory data
- **Features**: Multi-platform support, SoQL queries, geographic filters
- **Rate Limits**: 1000 requests/hour per dataset

### 6. OpenCorporates Connector (`connectors/opencorps.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Corporate ownership and beneficial owner resolution
- **Data Sources**: Global corporate registry data
- **Output**: LLC structures, beneficial owners, corporate hierarchies
- **Features**: Fuzzy name matching, ownership chain tracing
- **Rate Limits**: 500 requests/month (free tier)

## Enhanced Scoring Engine (`lib/enhanced-scoring.ts`)

### Financial Modeling Capabilities
- **NOI Estimation**: From rent rolls, operating expense ratios
- **Dual-Engine Valuation**: Income + market approaches with cross-validation
- **Cap Rate Analysis**: Market-derived rates with confidence scoring
- **Leverage Metrics**: LTV, DSCR, debt yield calculations
- **Deal Scoring**: Comprehensive 0-100 scoring with classification

### CapSight Integration
- **Market-to-Street (MTS)**: Advanced comparable analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Statistical confidence in estimates
- **Risk Classification**: BUY/HOLD/AVOID with grade mapping (A/B/C)
- **Provenance Tracking**: Full audit trail of data sources

## Technical Implementation

### Type Safety
- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any` types in public interfaces
- **Interface Alignment**: All outputs conform to CapSight schema
- **Runtime Validation**: Input/output validation with detailed errors

### Error Handling & Resilience
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial data handling, fallback strategies
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter
- **Circuit Breakers**: Per-connector failure isolation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logs with correlation IDs

### Performance & Caching
- **Response Caching**: Intelligent cache expiry based on data freshness
- **Batch Processing**: Multi-record processing where supported
- **Rate Limit Respect**: Per-connector rate limiting with queues
- **Concurrent Processing**: Parallel connector execution where safe

### Integration Points
- **CLI Tool**: `run-ingestion.mjs` for batch processing
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/ingestion/run` and `/api/ingestion/health`
- **Orchestrator**: `lib/ingestion-orchestrator.ts` for workflow management
- **Webhook Integration**: Events emitted to n8n with schema validation

## Deployment Status

### Build Validation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Next.js build successful  
- ✅ All connectors type-safe
- ✅ Enhanced scoring integration complete

### Production Readiness
- ✅ Environment validation (Node 20.12.2)
- ✅ Strict TypeScript mode
- ✅ Error boundary implementation
- ✅ Observability hooks ready
- ✅ Contract test framework prepared

## Usage Examples

### CLI Ingestion
```bash
node run-ingestion.mjs --connectors=edgar,fred,census --cities="Austin,Denver" --batch-size=100
```

### API Ingestion
```bash
curl -X POST /api/ingestion/run -d '{"connectors":["socrata","hud"],"filters":{"city":"Austin"}}'
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
curl /api/ingestion/health
```

## Next Steps
1. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end validation with live APIs
2. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize batch sizes and concurrency
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Deploy observability stack
4. **Production Deployment**: Configure environment variables
5. **Data Quality Gates**: Implement golden tests and validation rules
