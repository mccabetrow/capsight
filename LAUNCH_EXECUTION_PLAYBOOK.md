## 🎯 Pilot Customer Acquisition (Days 1-14)

### Phase 1: Identify 5 Target Prospects (Day 1)
**Ideal Profile**:
- Regional developers or family offices
- $50M-$500M real estate AUM
- 10-50 transactions per year
- Technology-forward leadership

**Research Sources**:
- Local real estate journals and publications

### Phase 2: Outbound Campaign (Days 2-7)
**Email Template** (customize for each prospect):
```
Subject: Unlock arbitrage windows in [Dallas/Phoenix/etc.] before consensus

Hi [Name],

Your firm's recent [mention specific deal/press] caught my attention. We built CapSight to surface real estate arbitrage plays before they become obvious—by forecasting cap rate compression, NOI momentum, and financing shifts.

Top-tier shops are using it to time acquisitions and refis, plus prioritize which deals deserve underwriting resources.

Worth a 15-minute look? We're inviting 3 pilot partners in [City/Asset Type] for a 60-day trial at 50% off. Even one better-timed deal more than covers the cost.

Best,
[Your Name]
CapSight | [Phone] | capsight.ai
```

### Phase 3: Demo & Close (Days 8-14)
**Demo Script** (15 minutes):
1. **Pain Point** (2 min): "Everyone sees the same listings. Alpha lives in timing."
2. **Solution Demo** (8 min): Live walkthrough of opportunity scoring and forecasts  
3. **Social Proof** (2 min): "[Similar firm] found 2 deals in 30 days using this."
4. **Pilot Offer** (3 min): "60-day trial at $1,000/month. Success = 2+ opportunities worth underwriting."

**Target**: 2-3 pilot customers signed by Day 14.
