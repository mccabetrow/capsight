Hi [First Name],

Quick question about your industrial loan underwriting process: How much time and budget goes toward property valuations, and how confident are you in their accuracy?

**Industry Problem**:

- Cost $3K-$8K per property (expensive for portfolio surveillance) 
- Vary by ±15-20% between appraisers (creating underwriting risk)

**CapSight Solution**:
- **Sub-2 second valuations** with confidence intervals
- **8.7% MAPE accuracy** (better than traditional appraisals)
- **$0.20-$2.50 per valuation** depending on volume
- **99.9% uptime** for consistent portfolio monitoring

**Lending Use Cases**:
- **Origination**: Rapid preliminary valuations for deal qualification
- **Portfolio Surveillance**: Monthly monitoring of collateral values
- **Workout/REO**: Quick asset disposition valuations
- **Risk Management**: Early warning systems for portfolio stress

**What [Similar Lender] told us**:
*"CapSight reduced our average underwriting timeline from 45 days to 12 days while giving us more confidence in collateral values. The ROI was immediate."*

**Technical Integration**:
- REST API with complete documentation
- Webhook support for automated portfolio monitoring  
- Enterprise security (SOC 2 Type II, encryption, audit logs)
- Custom reporting and data exports

The platform currently covers the 5 largest industrial markets (DFW, IE, ATL, PHX, SAV) representing ~40% of US industrial transaction volume.

**Demo request**: I'd love to show you a live underwriting scenario with a recent industrial loan. 15 minutes to see:

## Template 4: Investment Managers (Follow-up)

**Subject**: Following up on CapSight industrial valuation platform | Quick question

---

[First Name],

I sent a note last week about CapSight's industrial valuation platform - wanted to follow up with a specific question:

**What's your biggest challenge with property valuations right now?**

Based on conversations with similar investment managers, I typically hear:
- "Appraisals take too long and slow down our deal flow"
- "We need more frequent portfolio updates but can't afford constant appraisals"  
- "Valuation consistency across our portfolio is a problem"
- "We want more transparency in the valuation methodology"

CapSight was built to solve exactly these problems:

✅ **Speed**: 2-second API response vs 3-week appraisals  
✅ **Cost**: $0.50-$2.50 per valuation vs $3,000-$8,000 appraisals
✅ **Transparency**: See all comps and weighting methodology  
✅ **Accuracy**: 8.7% MAPE vs 15-20% appraisal variance

**5-minute demo available**: I can show you exactly how it works with properties from your target markets.

**Or if timing isn't right**: Happy to send you our technical documentation and sample reports so you can evaluate when it makes sense.

What would be most helpful?

Best,
[Your name]
