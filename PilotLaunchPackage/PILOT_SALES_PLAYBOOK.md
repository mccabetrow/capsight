### Outreach Templates

#### Cold Email #1: Market Entry
**Subject**: Unlock arbitrage windows in [Dallas/Phoenix/etc.] before consensus

Hi [Name],

Your firm's track record in [market/asset class] caught my attention. We built CapSight to surface real estate arbitrage plays before they become obviousâ€”by forecasting cap rate compression, NOI momentum, and financing shifts.

Top-tier shops are using it to time acquisitions and refis, plus prioritize which deals deserve underwriting resources.

Worth a 15-minute look? We're inviting 3 pilot partners in [City/Asset Type] for a 60-day trial at 50% off. Even one better-timed deal more than covers the cost.

Best,  
[Your Name]  
CapSight (capsight.ai)

#### Follow-up Email #2: Social Proof
**Subject**: Re: [Previous subject] - How [Similar Firm] found 2 deals in 30 days

[Name],

Just wrapped a call with [Similar Firm in Same Market]â€”they've identified 2 actionable opportunities in their first 30 days with CapSight, including a value-add play they're now underwriting.

Their words: *"The timing intelligence is what we've been missing. Finally know WHEN to move, not just WHERE."*

Still open to a quick demo this week? I think you'd see similar results in [Their Market].

Best,  
[Your Name]

#### Meeting Request Email
**Subject**: 15-min CapSight demo - Tuesday 2pm or Wednesday 10am?

Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest! I have two slots open this week for a CapSight demo:

- **Tuesday 2:00-2:15 PM EST**
- **Wednesday 10:00-10:15 AM EST**

I'll show you exactly how we identify arbitrage windows and what [Similar Firm] found in their first month. You'll get a temporary Pro account to test drive after the call.

Which works better?

Best,  
[Your Name]

## ðŸ“‹ Discovery Call Framework

### Pre-Call Research (5 minutes)
- Check their recent acquisitions (public records)
- Review website for AUM, asset types, markets
- LinkedIn for decision maker background
- Any press releases or interviews

### Opening (2 minutes)
**"Thanks for the time, [Name]. I did some homeworkâ€”saw you closed on the [Property] deal in [Month]. Great location. 

Before I show you what we built, help me understand: when you're sourcing deals today, what's your biggest challenge? Finding opportunities, or knowing WHEN to act on them?"**

*[Listen for timing vs sourcing pain points]*

### Demo Flow (10 minutes)

1. **Problem Setup** (2 minutes)
   - "Everyone sees the same listings. Alpha lives in timing."
   - "We built CapSight because spreadsheet models don't predict market inflection points."

2. **Live Demo** (6 minutes)  
   - Show 3-4 opportunities in their market
   - Pick one: "This property scores 85/100 for arbitrage potential"
   - Walk through the why: cap rate compression forecast, NOI growth, financing window
   - Scenario modeling: "What if rates drop vs. rise?"

3. **Proof Point** (2 minutes)
   - "[Similar Firm] found 2 deals in 30 days using this"
   - "ROI on just one better-timed deal pays for CapSight for years"

### Closing (3 minutes)
**"Here's what I'd propose: 60-day pilot at $1,000/monthâ€”half our normal Pro rate. I'll set you up with full access today. 

Success looks like: you finding 2-3 opportunities worth underwriting. If it doesn't help you close better deals, don't continue. Fair?"**

### Objection Handling

**"We already have good deal flow"**  
*"That's greatâ€”this isn't about more deals, it's about better timing on the deals you're already seeing. When do you make offers vs. wait? That's where CapSight shines."*

**"Our models are pretty sophisticated"**  
*"I'm sure they are. But do they predict market inflection points 3-6 months out? Most don't factor in cap rate trajectory or financing windows. That's the gap we fill."*

**"Need to discuss with the team"**  
*"Totally understand. What if I set up a team demo for next week? Everyone can see it live and ask questions. I'll also give you a test account to explore before the bigger meeting."*

**"Price seems high"**  
*"I get it. Here's the math: our average customer finds 1-2 additional deals per year they wouldn't have timed right otherwise. Even a $2M property with 5% better IRR from timing = $400K+ value over 5 years. CapSight pays for itself 10x over."*

## ðŸ“ž Talk Track Essentials

### Why Now?
*"Finding deals from listings is completely commoditizedâ€”everyone sees the same opportunities on LoopNet. The alpha is in timing: knowing when cap rates are about to compress, when NOI has momentum, when financing windows are optimal. That's predictable with the right data."*

### Proof Points  
*"We're not just another deal sourcing tool. We forecast market inflection points. Our models predicted the Q2 cap rate compression 8 weeks early. The shops using CapSight had first-mover advantage."*

### Low-Risk Trial
*"Look, real estate moves fast, but decisions don't have to be rushed. Take CapSight for a 60-day spin at pilot pricing. Success metric: does it help you time 2+ deals better? If not, no harm done."*

### ROI Anchor
*"Think about your last deal. What if you'd bought 3 months earlier or sold at peak instead of lagging the market? Even 50 basis points of IRR improvement on a $5M acquisition = $750K+ in additional value. CapSight pays for itself on just one better-timed deal."*
