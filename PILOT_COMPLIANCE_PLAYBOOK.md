# Verify response has: disclaimer, confidence, model_version, generated_at

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/forecasts?limit=1"

})
```

#### B. Model Metadata Visibility

## 🎯 No-Surprises Buyer Talk Track

### For Prospects/Legal Counsel:

*"CapSight is a decision-support tool, not investment advice. Every forecast includes confidence ranges, model version stamps, and clear disclaimers about limitations. Your team retains full decision authority—we just make market timing windows more visible. Our contracts limit liability to fees paid, your data stays yours, and we use anonymized aggregates to improve the models. We've designed this specifically to stay in the software tool safe harbor, not cross into advisory services."*

### For Technical Due Diligence:

*"All predictions are logged with audit trails, model versions are tracked, confidence intervals are always displayed, and we have comprehensive disclaimer coverage on every page that shows financial data. The system passes automated compliance tests and generates CSV exports for legal review if needed."*
